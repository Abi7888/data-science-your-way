# Data Science Engineering, your way

#### An introduction to different Data Science engineering concepts and Applications using Python and R  

This series of tutorials and applications are meant to be a guide to the **data science engineering** newcomer. In them we want to introduce basic conepts and tools esential to build any data product in two of the most popular platforms nowadays, Python and R.  

## Tutorials

This is a growing list of tutorials explaining concepts and applications in Python and R. 

### Introduction to Data Frames  

An introduction to the basic data structure and how to use it in Python/Pandas and R.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis  

About this important task in any data science engineering project.  

### Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering  

About using Principal Component Analysis and k-means Clustering to better represent and understand our data.  

### Text Mining and Sentiment Classification  

How to use text mining techniques to analyse the positive or non-positive sentiment of text documents using just *linear methods*.  

## Applications  

These are some of the applications we have built using the concepts explained in the tutorials.  

### A web-based Sentiment Classifier using R and Shiny
